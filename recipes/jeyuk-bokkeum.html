    <h2>Description</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>Jeyuk bokkeum is spicy marinated pork, also called dweji bulgogi (돼지불고기) or pork bulgogi. The marinade is a fragrant mixture of ginger, garlic, and gochujang (seasoned fermented red chili paste).</p>
    <p>It can be served in a variety of ways. As a filling for lettuce wraps, a topping for rice bowls, or by itself with side dishes. The combination of sweet and spicy flavors pairs well with many other side dishes.</p>
    <p>Slicing the meat thinly speeds up both the marinating and grilling processes, and maximizes the amount of char-grilled flavor you get (more surface area).</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <hr>
    <ul>
        <li>2 pounds pork belly or shoulder</li>
        <li>1/2 medium onion</li>
        <li>3 scallions</li>
        <li>red or green leaf lettuce, for serving</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Marinade</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>6 tablespoons gochujang</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon korean red chili flakes (gochugaru)</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons rice wine or mirin</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons sugar or brown sugar</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons sesame oil</li>
        <li>2 cloves fresh garlic</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon fresh grated ginger</li>
        <li>1/2 apple, grated</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <hr>
    <ol>
        <li>Slice the pork and onions thinly and cut the scallions into bite-size pieces (about 2 inches).</li>
        <li>Combine marinade ingredients in large resealable plastic bag. Add sliced meat, scallions, and onions. Toss to coat evenly.<p>NOTE: Marinating in a plastic bag makes it easier to toss the ingredients for even coverage of the marinade.</p></li>
        <li>Let rest for at least 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Transfer marinated ingredients into a bowl and set aside.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a frying pan.</li>
        <li>Stir fry the marinated ingredients in 2 batches over medium-high heat until caramelized.
            <p>NOTE: Do not overfill the pan. Too many ingredients in the pan will cause the meat to take longer to cook and the outside will burn before it is cooked through.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Remove from heat, garnish with toasted sesame seeds, and serve over lettuce.</li>
    </ol>
