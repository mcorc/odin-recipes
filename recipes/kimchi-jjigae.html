    <h2>Description</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>Kimchi jjigae is stew made with old, sour kimchi, a classic Korean comfort food. It is often made with fatty pork (belly or ribs), which pairs well with the strongly acidic and spicy kimchi. The stew is rounded out with tofu and scallions to add body, texture, and flavor.</p>
    <p>For the broth, traditionally the water from rinsing rice is used to thicken the stew, as it contains starch. You can use chicken, vegetable, or anchovy broth for a stronger flavor. The juice from the kimchi is an important component of the broth. If not using kimchi juice, add more salt to compensate.</p>
